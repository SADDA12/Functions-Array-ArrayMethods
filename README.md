1. Slice and Dice: Write a function that takes an array and uses the slice method to return a new array containing only the elements from index 2 to index 5 (inclusive). Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

2. Splice and Replace: Write a function that takes an array and uses the splice method to replace the elements at index 3 and 4 with the values "newElement1" and "newElement2". Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

3. Push Elements: Write a function that takes an array and uses the push method to add the elements "newElement1" and "newElement2" to the end of the array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

4. Pop Element: Write a function that takes an array and uses the pop method to remove the last element from the array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

5. Unshift Elements: Write a function that takes an array and uses the unshift method to add the elements "newElement1" and "newElement2" to the beginning of the array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

6. Shift Element: Write a function that takes an array and uses the shift method to remove the first element from the array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

7. Square Each Element: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses the forEach method to square each element in the array, storing the result in a new array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

8. Double Each Element: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses the forEach method to double each element in the array, storing the result in a new array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

9. Remove Odd Numbers: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses the forEach method to create a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.

10. Concatenate Arrays: Write a function that takes two arrays and uses the push and forEach methods to concatenate the elements of the second array to the first array. Repeat the exercise using an arrow function.
